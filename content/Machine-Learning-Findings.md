I've recently found out this series of lessons about Machine Learning Recipes from Google!

Super easy to follow, it gives overview of the basics of Machine Learning with Python!

Is there something better than that? ;)

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKxRvEZd3Mw) is the link to the first tutorial video.

Have fun (machine) learning!
